HOW TO USE:

1. Get one player to correctly run the server (either via port forwarding or hamachi http://vpn.net)

2. Open Dota 2 client

3. Make sure you are running Dota 2 in BORDERLESS WINDOW dx11

4. Run the dota2MatchmakingClient

5. Connect to the server via ip only

6. Put dota 2 in the foreground

7. type `start` in the server console and wait for same match

NOTES:

1. This program will have higher chance of finding same match, if you are in similar mmr range (100-500 difference) (also depends on time of day you are queueing).

2. MAKE SURE you have the same queue settings. (server location, language pref, game mode)

3. Also, play on a less active server, in order to minimize the probability of both players finding different matches at the same time.

4. Current version has been tested on 2 clients

5. Since this is in alpha, every time you disconnect from server it is advised to restart the server and client.
