HOW TO USE:

1. Make sure both clients are running dota in BORDERLESS WINDOW dota 2

2. Make sure you port forward port 6881 OR use hamachi (http://vpn.net)

3. Run winserver.exe

4. Connect with dota2MatchmakingSync client by typing IP into console and pressing enter

5. When ready, put dota in foreground, type `start` in server console

6. To stop, type `stop` in server console


NOTES:

1. This program will have higher chance of finding same match, if you are in similar mmr range (100-400 difference).

2. MAKE SURE you have the same queue settings. (server location, language pref, game mode)

3. Also, play on a less active server, in order to minimize the probability of both players finding different matches at the same time.

4. Current version has been tested on 2 clients

5. Since this is in alpha, every time you disconnect from server it is advised to restart the server and client.
